# War_Game
This game is about two players playing with deck of 52 cards having half of them each.

In the beginning each player contains 26 cards. if the value of the card of one player is greater than the other then the player with highest card value will take the player's card of lower value.if the value of cards is same for both players;then the actual war begins. #war logic both the players take a set of cards;in this logic I considered 5,then tha game logic goes for these 5cards.if any player wins,then that player will take all the five cards and vice versa.
